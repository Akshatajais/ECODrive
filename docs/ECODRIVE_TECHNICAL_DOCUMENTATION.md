# EcoDrive — Technical Documentation (IEEE-Ready)

**Project:** EcoDrive (Smart Vehicle Emission Monitoring + On-device ML)  
**Repository:** `pollutionapp`  
**Document type:** System technical documentation suitable for an IEEE-style project report

## Cover page blurb (copy/paste)

EcoDrive is an end-to-end smart vehicle monitoring system that integrates embedded sensing (ESP32 firmware), cloud data synchronization (Firebase Realtime Database), messaging (MQTT), and a Flutter mobile application with on-device machine learning. The system streams emission-related telemetry, logs historical data, triggers alerts, and provides interpretable insights for both driver behavior and vehicle health. ML models are trained using a Firebase-seeded hybrid pipeline (real historical distributions + realistic synthetic sessions) and deployed as quantized TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference on mobile devices.

## Abstract (150–200 words)

Vehicle emissions reflect complex interactions between driver behavior, vehicle condition, and environment; as a result, point-wise thresholds often produce noisy alerts. This project presents EcoDrive, an end-to-end monitoring system combining embedded sensors, cloud synchronization, and mobile analytics with on-device machine learning. An ESP32 firmware module acquires gas and environmental readings, computes an emission score, publishes telemetry via MQTT, and mirrors live and historical data into Firebase Realtime Database. A Flutter application consumes Firebase/MQTT streams to render dashboards, time-series graphs, and alert logs, and runs session-based ML inference locally to estimate driver behavior and vehicle health. The ML pipeline transforms Firebase history into session windows, derives statistical structure, generates realistic synthetic sessions, applies rule-based pseudo-labeling for supervised training, and exports int8 quantized TensorFlow Lite models with consistent preprocessing metadata. The resulting system supports real-time monitoring, historical review, and portable inference, while emphasizing reproducible workflows and clear interfaces between firmware, cloud data paths, and app components.

## 1. System overview

EcoDrive consists of three major subsystems:

- **Firmware (`iot_code/`)**: ESP32 reads sensors, computes an emission score, and pushes telemetry to MQTT and Firebase.
- **ML pipeline (`ML/`)**: Python pipeline builds session-based models for driver behavior and vehicle health; exports TFLite artifacts for mobile.
- **Mobile app (Flutter `lib/`)**: UI + state management, connects to Firebase and MQTT, renders dashboards/graphs/alerts, runs TFLite inference locally, and displays camera stream URLs when available.

### Data-plane summary

- **Realtime telemetry**: MQTT topic `ecodrive/pollution` (JSON payload).
- **Cloud state**: Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB), under the `carEmissions/` namespace.

---

## 2. Repository layout

Top-level structure (key folders):

- `iot_code/` — ESP32 firmware (Arduino-style C++)
- `ML/` — Python ML pipeline, training scripts, and exported models
- `lib/` — Flutter application code (UI, providers, services)
- `docs/` — project documentation (this file, plus ML methodology)

---

## 3. Interfaces and data contracts

### 3.1 MQTT contract (firmware → app)

- **Broker**: `broker.hivemq.com` (port 1883)
- **Topic**: `ecodrive/pollution`
- **Payload**: JSON string with fields:
  - `rawGas` (int/float)
  - `temperature` (float)
  - `humidity` (float)
  - `emissionScore` (int/float)
  - `timestamp` (string)

**Implementation notes**

- Firmware publishes with `PubSubClient` (at-least-once semantics depend on broker/client configuration).
- Flutter subscribes via `mqtt_client` and emits a broadcast stream of decoded JSON maps.

### 3.2 Firebase RTDB schema (firmware/app shared)

All project paths are under `carEmissions/`:

- `carEmissions/liveData`  
  Latest telemetry record (JSON object).

- `carEmissions/history/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HH-MM-SS>`  
  Historical records keyed by date folder and time key (JSON object).

- `carEmissions/alerts/<alertId>`  
  Alert records; firmware writes when `emissionScore >= 400`.

- `carEmissions/camera`  
  Camera metadata (used by the Flutter camera feed screen/provider):
  - `streamUrl` (string, e.g., `http://<ip>:82`)
  - `captureUrl` (string, e.g., `http://<ip>:81/capture`)
  - `timestamp` (string)

---

## 4. Firmware subsystem (`iot_code/`)

### 4.1 Hardware inputs

- **MQ-7 gas sensor** on analog pin `MQ7_PIN` (configured as GPIO 34)
- **DHT22** temperature/humidity sensor on `DHTPIN` (configured as GPIO 4)
- **I2C LCD** on SDA/SCL configured via `Wire.begin(21, 22)`

### 4.2 Firmware logic

Key behaviors in `iot_code/main.cpp`:

- Connect to Wi-Fi using `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`
- Configure NTP time for timestamps
- Initialize Firebase client (`Firebase_ESP_Client`)
- Publish to MQTT (`PubSubClient`)
- Every `interval = 5000 ms`:
  - read sensors
  - compute `emissionScore` using a calibrated mapping
  - update LCD
  - write `liveData`, append into `history`, and conditionally write `alerts`
  - publish MQTT JSON payload

### 4.3 Emission score computation

The firmware maps raw gas readings into a bounded score:

- `cleanAir` and `maxSmoke` calibrate the expected raw sensor range.
- `calculateEmissionScore(rawGas)` maps raw values into approximately `[50, 500]`.

### 4.4 Optional ESP32-CAM support

`main.cpp` includes a camera integration guarded by `ENABLE_CAMERA`:

- Starts a **JPEG capture endpoint** at `http://<ip>:81/capture`
- Starts a **basic MJPEG stream** at `http://<ip>:82`
- Writes camera URLs to Firebase at `carEmissions/camera`

**Procedure to enable**

- Define `ENABLE_CAMERA` (compile flag or uncomment `#define ENABLE_CAMERA`)
- Compile for an ESP32-CAM board (AI Thinker pinmap is included)

**Constraint**

- ESP32-CAM pinout may conflict with pins used for LCD/DHT on standard ESP32 boards; treat camera mode as a dedicated build profile.

## 5. Mobile app subsystem (Flutter)

### 5.1 Core dependencies

From `pubspec.yaml` (selected):

- `firebase_core`, `firebase_database`, `firebase_storage`
- `mqtt_client`
- `provider`
- `tflite_flutter`
- `flutter_local_notifications`
- `fl_chart`, `syncfusion_flutter_gauges`

### 5.2 Application architecture

- **Entry point**: `lib/main.dart`
- **State management**: `provider` (ChangeNotifier + MultiProvider)
- **Navigation**: bottom navigation + `IndexedStack` (Dashboard, Camera, Alerts, Graphs, Insights, Settings)

### 5.3 Telemetry ingestion

`DriverScoreProvider`:

- Connects to Firebase RTDB:
  - live: `carEmissions/liveData`
  - alerts: `carEmissions/alerts`
  - history: `carEmissions/history`
- Connects to MQTT topic `ecodrive/pollution` in parallel and applies updates to the same in-app state.
- Maintains a rolling history list (also used by on-device ML inference).

`MqttService`:

- Subscribes to `broker.hivemq.com`
- Decodes JSON payloads and emits a typed stream of `Map<String, dynamic>`
- Auto-reconnect behavior enabled

### 5.4 Camera URL ingestion

`CameraStreamProvider`:

- Listens to RTDB path `carEmissions/camera`
- Extracts a URL from `streamUrl` (or similar keys) and exposes it to the UI.

### 5.5 Alerts and reminders

- Threshold-based alerts are generated in firmware (score ≥ 400) and logged under `carEmissions/alerts`.
- The app schedules reminders using `flutter_local_notifications` and stores scheduling state via a settings service.

## 6. ML subsystem (`ML/`) and deployment to Flutter

### 6.1 Pipeline purpose

The ML subsystem provides two session-based classifiers:

- Driver behavior: Eco / Normal / Aggressive / Idle-heavy
- Vehicle health: Healthy / Needs Service / Critical

### 6.2 Pipeline workflow (scripts)

Typical end-to-end run (see `ML/README.md`):

- `scripts.01_fetch_firebase` — fetch history from Firebase
- `scripts.02_prepare_dataset` — flatten + sessionize + compute stats
- `scripts.03_generate_synthetic` — generate realistic synthetic sessions
- `scripts.04_train_driver` — train driver behavior models
- `scripts.05_train_vehicle` — train vehicle health models
- `scripts.06_export_tflite` — export quantized TFLite models
- `scripts.07_export_preprocess_json` — export StandardScaler parameters to JSON for Flutter

### 6.3 Model artifacts used by Flutter

These artifacts are bundled as Flutter assets:

- `ML/models/driver_model.tflite`
- `ML/models/vehicle_model.tflite`
- `ML/models/driver_classes.txt`
- `ML/models/vehicle_classes.txt`
- `ML/models/driver_preprocess.json`
- `ML/models/vehicle_preprocess.json`

### 6.4 On-device inference (Flutter)

The on-device inference service:

- Computes session features from recent buffered telemetry (rolling window)
- Applies standardization using `*_preprocess.json`
- Quantizes to int8 based on the interpreter tensor parameters
- Runs inference using `tflite_flutter`
- Dequantizes outputs and applies softmax to compute confidence/probabilities

## 7. Setup and run procedures

### 7.1 Firebase setup (project-level)

The Flutter app expects Firebase to be configured. Standard procedure:

1. Install FlutterFire CLI.
2. Run `flutterfire configure` for this Flutter project.
3. Ensure `Firebase.initializeApp()` succeeds at runtime.

If Firebase is not configured, the app falls back to mock/demo behavior for some views.

### 7.2 Flutter app (local development)

From repository root:

- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`

Android build:

- `flutter build apk --debug`

### 7.3 Firmware build/flash

The firmware is Arduino-style ESP32 code and must be built with:

- Arduino IDE + Espressif ESP32 core, or
- PlatformIO (recommended)

**Note:** Compiling with desktop `g++` will fail due to missing ESP32 headers (e.g., `WiFi.h`).

### 7.4 ML pipeline execution

From `ML/`:

1. Create and activate a Python venv.
2. Install `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure `.env` (service account JSON, RTDB URL, history path).
4. Run scripts 01→06 to train and export models; run 07 to export scaler JSON.

## 9. Implementation notes (engineering details)

### 9.1 Reliability and offline behavior

- MQTT and Firebase ingestion run in parallel; the app can continue with whichever is available.
- When sensors are offline, previously stored Firebase history can still support ML analysis.
- Camera connectivity is exposed as a URL contract; the app does not depend on a specific camera transport beyond HTTP stream URL availability.

### 9.2 Security considerations (recommended)

For production deployments:

- Avoid hardcoding credentials in firmware source.
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict read/write paths.
- Prefer per-device auth tokens and scoped permissions.
